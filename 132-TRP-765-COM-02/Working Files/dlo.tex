\section*{Desired Learning Objectives}
 	\paragraph{
    		Completion of the following objectives, as well as a proficiency in the TRPs leading up to the COM-01 lesson should leave the TR with all he needs to know in order to plan and execute a normal flight (NAVEX or transit). Not only giving the TR a solid base from which to work on additional flying and combat skills - but to be an asset to his flight lead already. \\
    } 
    
  	\textnormal{\\ On completion, the TR should be able to prepare the basics for his flight:}
  	\begin{itemize}
  		\item[-] Be able to use the ATO to find correct frequencies for his flight
  		\item[-] Using the information available on the event pages, find information about his flight prior to launch
  		\item[-] Upon completion of the flight, write good AARs and Debriefs following the guidelines within this document
	\end{itemize}
    
	\textnormal{\\ The TR should have a clear overview of phase of a flight:}
  	\begin{itemize}
    	\item[-] Know how to establish correct communication with FL or ATC
    	\item[-] Know the agencies one can expect to interact with during a flight
    	\item[-] Know how to ask for the required clearances from the various agencies during a flight
        \item[-] Know how to correctly approach the airfield, and how to perform a straight-in landing
    \end{itemize}
    
    \textnormal{\\ In addition, the TR should have acquired the following abilities:}
  	\begin{itemize}
    	\item[-] Be able to use guard frequency to communicate with others
    	\item[-] Be able to taxi on the airfield using ground- and VAD charts
    	\item[-] Be able to set altimeter for airfield QNH and understand why we use QNH
        \item[-] Be able to set altimeter for Standard Pressure Settings (SPS, 1013 mBar) above 8000ft, and return to QNH when descending below FL090
    \end{itemize}
