\section*{Introduction}
  \paragraph{
  	Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW\&C) systems are airborne radar systems designed to detect aircraft, ships and vehicles at long ranges and perform command and control of the battle-space in an air engagement by directing fighter and attack aircraft strikes. AEW\&C units are also used to carry out surveillance, including over ground targets and frequently perform C2BM (command and control, battle management) functions similar to an Air Traffic Controller given military command over other forces. In terms of the 132nd vWing, this means our E-3 Sentry aircraft better known as AWACS (Airborne Warning and Control System) \\ \\
  }
  
  \textnormal{
  	132nd AWACS are manned by a Senior Weapons Director (SD) and one or more Weapon Directors (WD) from the 176th vACS. As a pilot within the 765th this will be the agency providing you with Command \& Control (C2) and your flight will be at their disposal for tasking/re-tasking in order to accomplish the goals set by the Joint Force Commander (JFC), Air Mission Commander (AMC) or other governing authority \\
