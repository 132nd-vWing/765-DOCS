# 765 DOCs

Welcome to the 765th document repository!

### Creating/Updating documents
1. Clone the base repo:
<pre>$ git clone https://github.com/132nd-vWing/765-DOCS.git </pre>

2. Figure out what your document is supposed to be named (i.e "132-TRP-765-COM-01")

3. Create and check out a new branch with the name of your document:
<pre>$ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch] </pre>

3. Create a new folder with the name of your document
   - If your document is part of any training/presentation, create a folder name ```Lesson Files```. This is where the instructors will find any resources needed
   - create a folder name ```Working Files```. This folder contains any ```*.doc```, ```*.tex```, ```*.md```, illustrations and any other files needed to compile your document into a pdf
   - <b>The compiled document should be named the same as your folder and put in is root directory as a PDF</b>
